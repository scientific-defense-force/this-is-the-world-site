      WENAO (<b>W</b>estern <b>E</b>urope <b>N</b>orth <b>A</b>merica <b>O</b>ceania + Japan) countries are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" target="_blank">OECD</a> countries that joined up to 1973 before a ~20 year gap to more countries joining. They represent the wealthiest countries that in terms of total household wealth have benefitted the most from globalization.

<h2>This Isn't The Full Picture Though</h2>

<p>This simplifies things into 2 main groups, however in actuality there are 4. Let's drill into the wealth distribution of the WENAO and non-WENAO countries.</p>

<p>Note: 1% = 1% wealthiest people in a given bracket. 99% = The rest. Same with 10% v 90%</p>

<h2>Let's Make This Clearer</h2>
<p>The following is obviously a broard generalization, but generally this is the breakdown.</p>

  <h3>The Precariat</h3>
  <p>
    The non-WENAO 90% makes up 77% of the worlds population. Not all (but a large majority) of these people can be considered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precariat" target="_blank">the precariat</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>The Precariat: Attributes</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Globally they are on very low pay</li>
      <li>They have little to no ability to negotiate on wages or conditions</li>
      <li>Loss of employment could be life threatening or result in permanent homelessness</li>
      <li>* They are forced into the global system of production</li>
    </ul>

    * Prior to globalization, these people might have worked in local industry, eg. farming. However, due to increasingly free trade and lowered costs of distribution, local industry typically cannot compete with global corporations.
  </p>

  <h3>The Global Elite</h3>
  <p>
    The global elite are the primary benefactors of globalization as they are able to harvest the vast majority of the surplus that the precariat generate. Not everyone in the top 1% is in the global elite. It's debatable at what level the global elite starts.
  </p>
  <h4>The Global Elite: Attributes</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily based in WENAO countries</li>
      <li>They are owners, not employees</li>
      <li>They use their wealth to influence government policy</li>
      <li>They use tax loopholes to avoid a large amount of tax</li>
      <li>They have media influence</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>The Machine Operators</h3>
  <p>
    The global elite, which are a tiny fraction of the worlds popluation, cannot manage the process of harvesting the surplus of the precariat by themselves. A large number of people are required to manage the logistics, hardware and software necessary for this process.
  </p>
  <h4>The Machine Operators: Attributes</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily based in WENAO countries</li>
      <li>Have skills through a good education</li>
      <li>Are paid enough to live well and accumulate a small amount of wealth</li>
      <li>May not work directly for the global elite, but in ancillary roles eg. health care</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>The Gatekeepers</h3>
  <p>
    The gatekeepers manage the precariat and 'bring them online' into the global system. The global elite aren't in a good position to manage this process as they don't have a local presence in many of these countries, nor is particularly desirable as the profit to be made is relatively low compared to their main businesses.
  </p>
  <h4>The Gatekeepers: Attributes</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Based in non-WENAO countries</li>
      <li>Owners of factories or service centers made up of the precariat</li>
      <li>Not excessively wealthy as the global market to employ the precariat is highly competitive</li>
    </ul>
