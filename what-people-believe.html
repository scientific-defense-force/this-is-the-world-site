<h2 class="page-header">What People Believe</h2>
<p>People refers to those most likely to visit this site. Those who have the technology and the free time to be interested in such a topic. Which is to say the 'machine operators' or the WENAO (<b>W</b>estern <b>E</b>urope <b>N</b>orth <b>A</b>merica <b>O</b>ceania + Japan) middle class.</p>
<p>'People' correctly understand that there are wealthy and poor counties. The key misunderstanding is the reasons for this difference and the relationship between the poor and wealthy countries.</p>
<h2>The First World</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Democracy - Democracy is the key reason for the wealth of the first world. The democratic process keeps corruption in check and enables prosperity.</li>
    <li>Free market capitalism - Primarily democracy protects free market capitalism, which allows for the generation of new wealth through new ideas and technology.</li>
    <li>Freedom - Key to this is the concept that people are free to choose their employer or to start a business themselves.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>The Rest</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corruption - The poorer countries either have corrupted democracies or are varients of dictatorships.</li>
    <li>Restricted markets - The political corruption leads to corrupted markets. Those with new ideas cannot compete with established businesses and thus advancement and the raising of wealth is stymied.</li>
    <li>Oppression - The people have limited freedom and are further prevented from fighting for improvements to their countries through invidual effort.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Is This Belief Valid?</h2>
<p>These beliefs are exagerated but not invalid. Still they miss the key reason for the existence and continuation of poor and rich countries. Why?</p>
<p>
  The core misunderstanding is that the most important difference is the countries internal makeup. There is the implication that if the poor countries could replicate the political systems of the wealthy countries they could be similarly successful.
</p>
<p>
  Through capitalism becoming globally dominant and the advance of globalization the factor that determines if your country is rich or poor is where it fits into the global system. Or more to the point it is where the corporations in your country rank on the global scale.
</p>
<p>
  Through globalization businesses now compete at a global level. You could apply a progressive democracy to a poor country but due to economies of scale and technological advantage there is no way that local business in those countries can compete with the likes of Apple, Google or Microsoft. They often can't even compete in terms of food production despite the advantage of being local and having cheaper distribution costs.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of their political makeup, they need to make money in the global system. What do they have? They have a large number of poorly educated poor people who need work and can work cheaply. Their only real option is to facilitate these people being employed by foreign companies for low wages.
</p>
<h2>The Rich Countries Fight To Persist This Arrangement</h2>
<p>The poor countries are doubly unable to improve their position in the global system as the wealthy countries actively work to suppress their advancement.</p>
<h3>Free trade agreements favor the rich countries</h3>
<p>There is a long string of trade agreements that favor the already wealthy countries. The poor countries are excluded and thus are further disadvantaged. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" target="_blank">OECD</a> is the primary organization that works towards the benefit of the rich countries.</p>
