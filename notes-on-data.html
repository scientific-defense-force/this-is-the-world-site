<h2 class="page-header">Notes About The Data</h2>
<p>The data comes from the <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/au/en/about-us/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report.html" target="_blank">Credit Suisse global wealth report</a>. This report is the best source for global wealth. It is not perfect, but is accurate enough to draw general conclusions from.</p>
<p>
  The data from the global wealth databook is aggregated via <a href="https://github.com/open-socialism/tw-ingestion" target="_blank">this code</a> and some basic calculations on the output.
</p>

<h2>Notable flaws in the data on this site</h2>
<p>
  The main issue with the usage of the data is you cannot put people in brackets by wealth alone. Eg. Someone in debt in a non-WENAO country may not be one of the precariat, but one of the wealthy, but just heavily invested in some endeavour.
</p>
<p>
  However, overall the generalizations made by level of wealth a quite accurrate and are sufficient to draw conclusions from.
